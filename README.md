# recipe

Recipe is a minimalist web application developed to demonstrate skills in Vue 3, Vuex, options, and the Composition API. 
While it prioritizes functionality over fancy UI design, Recipe serves as a practical example of managing state and building a Vue application using options, and the Composition API.
